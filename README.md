Infrared remote control experiments
=====

The aim is to have a tiny transmitter which works with the OpenPandora without compromising on its handheld quality. (For receivers, this is not a problem, because they are generally resting on a solid surface while you send them signals from somewhere else. But for a transmitter, handheld is very useful!)

Currently using very simple descriptions of the waveforms. Later it would be useful to handle the actual protocols, e.g. integrate with LIRC.
